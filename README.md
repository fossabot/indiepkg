# IndiePKG

A package manager written in go for small CLI programs. It is available on GNU/Linux and macOS.

## Notice

IndiePKG is **NOT** ready for use yet. It's still extremely early software.

However, if you would like to submit issues or PR's, you are **more** than welcome to.

## What is IndiePKG?

IndiePKG is mainly for small simple CLI and TUI programs. Most of them are just for fun, such as **cmatrix**, while others have a bit more utility such as **btop**.

IndiePKG as stated in the name is a lot easier to submit your package. All packages are installed from git, which makes all the packages you install completely unmodified. That's because it automatically compiles everything for you.

It's also much simpler than your standard package manager, and if a package installation goes wrong you don't have to worry about all your packages failing, because you can super easily remove it.
